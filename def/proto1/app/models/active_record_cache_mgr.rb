  # * p - (optional) a Proc object to use in loading a value it if is not
  #   found in the cache.  (In other words, if my_cache[key] would return nil,
  #   p.call(key) will be called to get the value, and the value will be

    # Caches find_by_[field] calls for the specified fields, and overrides
    # find() so that if find(:all) is called, those caches are populated.
    # If :id is one of the fields cached, then find(id) will use the id cache
    # (as well as find_by_id).  This method results in faster accesses (about 13
    # times faster in my test) than if you use cache_find_calls, and about 387
    # times faster than the regular ActiveRecord calls.  You can use both this
    # method and cache_find_calls in the same model class if you call the
    # latter after this method, in which case the find_for_[field] calls set up
    # by this method are almost as fast, and all find calls are faster (the
    # second time) than if you weren't using the cache.
    # The (unnamed) arguments here should be a list of fields (as strings)
