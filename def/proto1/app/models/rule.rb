  # * ref_field_names - a set of the field names encountered so far
  # * ref_sub_field_names - a set of the sub-field names encountered so far. The
  #    reason to add this parameters is to avoid tp_test_value being treated as
  #    a trigger field during form loading period,
  #    For example, the show_when_done_field_only rule was unnecessaryly
  #    repeated for n times when calling runFormRules function on form loading
  #    (where n matches to the number of fields in tp_test_value column of a
  #    panel. The n can be >150 for some panel (e.g. searching it using keyword
  #    'uri' in add test and panel page). Sine the column tp_test_value was
  #    wrongly selected as the trigger, that rule has to be evaluated for each
  #    field in tp_test_value column.
  #    The fix here is trying to re-order the rule's field_descritpions list to
  #    change the trigger to non-column field (e.g. tp_panel_testdate). That way
  #    we can minimize the number of rule evalulation from n to 1 (also see
  #    trigger method in rule.rb for details). - Frank
