    # A method for searching the ferret index.

    #   this doesn't apply, and can be nil.
    # * query - the search query entered by the user
    # * conditions - some extra FQL (ferret query language) to be ANDed with
    #   the user's query.  This may be nil.
    # * fields_searched - the fields to be searched (as symbols)
    # * code_field - the table's column that contains the codes for the records
    # * fields_returned - an array of names of fields (as symbols) that should
    #   be returned as a hash when the data is sent back to the browser.
    #   (We don't actually use this anywhere, and one day, we might remove it,
    #   if it becomes clear that we never will use it.)
    # * fields_displayed - the fields to be displayed.  
    # * highlighting - if passed true, the values for the fields_displayed
    #                  fields will have highlighting on the matched terms.
    #                  if passed false, no highlighting will be applied.
    #                  (added 6/13/07)
    # * options - an optional hash of options to the ferret search engine
    #
    # Returns:
    # The total count available, an array of codes for the returned records,
    # a hash map (described below), and an array of record data (each of which
    # is an array whose elements are 
    # the values of the fields specified in the field_displayed parameter).
    # The hash map is from fields_returned elements to corresponding lists of
    # field values.  This structure was chosen to
    # minimize the size of the JSON version of the return data, because
    # the returned fields data gets included in the output sent back to
    # the web browser.  If highlighting is turned on, :display values will have
    # <span> tags around the terms that matched the query.
