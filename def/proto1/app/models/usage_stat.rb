  # Creates a new UsageStat object.
  #
  # Parameters:
  # * user_obj the user object if we have one.  It is possible that we will not
  #   have a user object for this call.  This will be the case for "prelogin"
  #   events - events that we track but that occur before the user has logged in.
  #   For example, we track use of the captcha object which comes up on the
  #   registration page and also on the "forgot id" page.  In both instances we
  #   don't have a user object when the event occurs.  This is OK.
  #
  # * profile_id the profile id, which may be nil - particularly when we don't
  #   have a user object, but also for events which occur at the user, rather
  #   than the profile, level (login, captcha, etc).
  #
  # * report_data an array containing arrays containing three elements:
  #   event type; date/time stamp for the event; event-specific data for the
  #   event.  This parameter is required.  See the Statistics design document
  #   on our TWIKI for a description of the event-specific data.
  #
  # * session_id the id of the session that generated the event.  This
  #   parameter is required.
  #
  # * ip_addr the ip_address from which this request originated.  This parameter
  #   is required.
  #
  # * convert_time an optional flag used to indicate whether or not to convert
  #   the date/time stamps in the report data.   Date/time stamps get converted
  #   to non-local time when they are sent from the client, because we use the
  #   Date.toISOString() javascript function to get a string that includes the
  #   fractional secons.  So this means we need to convert them to the
  #   local time for the server before storing them.  Date/time stamps created
  #   for events reported directly from the server do not have this problem and
  #   so don't require conversion to local time.  All time values are converted
  #   to a format using the FRAC_SECOND_FORMAT fractional time format string. 
  #   This parameter just adds conversion to local time.  The default value for
  #   the flag is true.
  #
  # Returns:
  # * nothing

  # This method looks for unassigned/incomplete login and captcha events and
  # attempts to complete the missing information.
  #
  # Incomplete login events are those that are not connected to a session id.
  # When a user logs in, the session id that is current at the time is deleted
  # and a new session id is created.  This is to block session hijacking
  # attempts.  The problem that it causes is that the new session id is not
  # assigned until after the login event is recorded - and after any code
  # executed during the login finishes.   So login events are initially written
  # with no session ids.
  #
  # This method attempts to find the appropriate session id for a login that is
  # missing one by finding the next event stored for the user id and ip address
  # of the target login event and, unless that subsequent event is also a login
  # or a captcha event, storing the session id from the subsequent event in
  # the data for the target login event.
  #
  # We assume that if the event immediately following the login is another login
  # or a captcha event, something went wrong and the session for the first login
  # was never used.
  #
  # Unassigned captcha events are those that are missing a user id.  This
  # method looks for the appropriate user id in two ways.
  #
  # After attempting to complete the session id of a login event, this method
  # checks to see if there are any captcha events with the old session id that
  # is stored in the login event's data column and a missing user_id.  If any
  # are found, they are assigned to the user who performed the login, with
  # the session id assigned to the login.
  #
  # After all incomplete logins are processed, this method checks for any
  # captcha events that are still missing a user id.  If any are found, this
  # searches for a logout event that immediately preceding the captcha event
  # that has the same user_id and session_id.  If a logout event is found,
  # the captcha event is assigned to the user who performed the logout.
