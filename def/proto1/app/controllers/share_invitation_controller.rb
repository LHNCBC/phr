  # The xhr_and_exception_filter around action is specified for this
  # method in the ApplicationController.
  #
  # This handles requests from the client to send an invitation to share access
  # to a PHR.  It checks the parameters passed in and, if the request is valid,
  # calls send_invitation to send the email, and then call create_invitation in
  # the ShareInvitation model class to store data for the invitation.
  #
  # A request is considered invalid if: it is missing any of the expected
  # parameters (as noted below); if the profile id_shown passed in is invalid
  # or if the current user is not the owner of that profile; or if the user
  # being invited to share access already has access to the profile.
  # 
  # This also returns an error if one occurs while trying to send the email,
  # or if an error occurs storing the invitation data, or if the amount of data
  # stored for the user has exceeded the limits.  The data size is figured after
  # the share invitation is stored.  In the case of a data size problem, the
  # user should get a message and be logged out.
  # 
  # Parameters (in params):
  # * :id_shown the profile id_shown or the PHR to be shared
  # * :invite_data a hash containing
  #     target_email - the email to which the invitation is to be sent
  #     target_name - the name of the person who is to receive the invitation
  #     issuer_name - the name (not username, but name - which we don't keep
  #                   on file) of the person issuing the invitation
  #     personalized_msg - a personalized message if the issuer provided one.
  #   All of those elements must be supplied, although the personalized_msg
  #   may be blank (but not nil).
  #
  # Returns:
  # * success or errors, as noted above

  # This handles an acceptance of a shared access invitation.  It first checks
  # the validity of the acceptance.   An acceptance is considered invalid if
  #  - the invitation cannot be found using the accept_key value passed to
  #    this as part of the url;
  #  - the 'sent to' email address returned in the url does not match the
  #    one on file to which the invitation was sent;
  #  - the invitation has already been accepted; or
  #  - the invitation has expired.
  #
  #  In any of those cases the user is presented with a page noting the problem
  #  and further processing ceases.
  #
  # If the acceptance is valid, the system determines whether or not the
  # user currently has an account with the system.  If not, the invitee is
  # presented with the registration/Sign Up page.  The text for the popup
  # message that is displayed over the registration page explains that an
  # account must be created before the access can be granted.  The access
  # is not actually implemented until after the registration process is
  # completed, by other code that is called.
  #
  # If the invitee already has an account with the system, a page is displayed
  # that confirms the access and provides a link to login if the invitee wishes
  # to do so.  In this case the access is implemented (set up in the database).
  #
  # Parameters (in params):
  # * :email the email address returned; should be the one to which the
  #    invitation was sent
  # * :invite_data the accept_key which was generated when the invitation was
  #    created
  #   Both of those elements must be supplied.

  # This updates pending invitations for the current user based on actions
  # (accept or decline) the user specifies on the pending invitations list
  # available from the phr home page.
  #
  # The xhr_and_exception_filter around action is specified for this
  # method in the ApplicationController.
  #
  # Parameters:
  # * invite_actions passed as a parameter in the http request.  This is a
  #   hash where the key is the profile_id in question, and the value is the
  #   action (accept or decline) specified by the user.
  #
  # Returns:
  # * a hash with two elements
  #    * key = acceptances; value = number of acceptances processed
  #    * key = has_pending; value = boolean indicating whether or not the
  #      user has remaining pending invitations.
  #   These two values are used to update the phr_home page as appropriate
  #   on return from this action.
