  # (status = 500) if the amount of data stored for the user has exceeded the
  # limits.  The user should get a message and be logged out.  Otherwise this

  # Parameters (in params):
  # * :report the event report array that should contain data for all the events
  #   being reported by the client for this request
  # * :id_shown the profile id shown, if any, for the events.  This is not the
  #   same as the actual id of the profile data.
  #
  # Returns:
  # * an error if a data overflow error is detected; otherwise nothing
