  # Returns a requested list of items obtainable through the current user's User
  # instance.  This is used for prefetched-list fields whose contents
  # come from user data (e.g. a list of PHRs).
  #
  # This method is invoked through the xhr_and_exception_filter, which will make
  # sure that it was called via an Ajax call and will handle any exceptions
  # thrown, e.g., from get_profile if the user does not have access to the profile
  #
  # Parameters:
  # * field_desc_id - the ID of the field description for the field requesting
  #   the list.  The control_type_detail of the field should contain a
  #   specification of the data for the list.  Three types of supported syntax
  #   are planned (but only the first below is implemented):
  #   1. The search_table parameter in control type detail contains something
  #      like "user phrs".  The presence of "user " is the indicator that
  #      the data is to be obtained from the user table (probably via a call
  #      to this method.)  The "phrs" (or whatever follows the space) is the
  #      name of the top level form table from which the data is to be obtained.
  #      The fields_displayed parameter specifies the column(s) of the table
  #      that are to be used in the list.
  #   2. The search_table parameter contains something like
  #      "user phr(:id) phr_drugs".  In this case the ":id" is intended
  #      to come from the params hash, and specifies the profile number.
  #      the "phr_drugs" indicates that what is requested is data from the
  #      phr_drugs table for the specified phr form record.
  #   3. The search_table parameter contains something like "user phr_drugs",
  #      and the data_req_input parameter contains something like
  #      "{profile_id=>profile_id}" and the implication is that the
  #      phr record id is coming in from the form as part of a handle_data_req
  #      request.

  # Returns the data a javascript ComboField needs to switch to a new field
  # input method (plain text or some form of a list).
  #
  # Parameters obtained from the params hashmap:

  #   be mimicked/created
  # * ff_id - the id (including prefix and suffix) of the form field
  #   that is to mimic a particular field type
  # * form_name - the name of the form that the form_field is on
  # * orig_ff_id - the id (NOT including prefix and suffix) of the form field
  #   being mimicked
  #
  # Returns: a JSON string of an array containing the following elements in
  #  the following order:
  #  1. field type - which is expressed using one of the constants defined in
  #     the combo_fields_helper and that correspond to those used by the
  #     javascript ComboField object.  This element is required.
  #
  #  2. tooltip - if a tooltip is specified for the field, the text of it
  #     will be placed here.  If no tooltip was specified, this will contain
  #     an empty string (but not nil).
  #
  #  3. a hash of parameters used to construct a RecordDataRequester.  If the
  #     field to be mimicked is not a list field, this element will not exist.
  #     If the field to be mimicked does not specify a RecordDataRequester,
  #     this element will be in the array, but will carry a null value.
  #
  #  4. a hash of parameters used to create the autocompleter for a list field.
  #     If the field to be mimicked is not a list field, this element will not
  #     exist.  Otherwise (since a list field is currently our only other
  #     option) this element will carry the hash of parameters.
  #
  #  5. an array of parameters needed to update existing autocompleters or
  #     fields that are dependent on other field values for their values.
  #
  #  This request is actually passed through to the get_combo_field_specs method
  #  in the combo_fields_helper.  The parameter hashes returned are the same

  # and (finally) a boolean indicating whether or not the array of record data
  # has HTML tags around the matched parts of the strings.
  # The hash map is from fields_returned elements to corresponding lists of
