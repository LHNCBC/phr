/** 
 * autosave.js -> The AutoSave object and methods
 *
 * This object and its methods implement the client-side processing for the
 * autosave feature, which is available only for certain forms that are used
 * to enter and update user data.
 *
 * These were broken out from the idle.js file to separate the two different
 * functionalities.

  /**
   * Processes an update provided by the data model (Def.DataModel).
   * 
   * This ASSUMES that the origData_ hash contains a hash for each table
   * on the form and a field entry for each field in existing rows, whether
   * or not it has data in it.  (This is the way the data_table_ in the
   * data model is structured).
   * 
   * The types of updates this function will receive are:
   * 
   * 1.  Updates to existing data (i.e., data that existed when the form
   *     was loaded).  These will include:
   *     a.  updated values for a field in an existing row;
   *     b.  a delete instruction for a row (where the field name will be
   *         'record_id' and the value will be the id number preceded by
   *         the word 'delete'); and
   *     c.  an undelete instruction for a row (where the field name will,
   *         again, be 'record_id' and the value will be the id number 
   *         WITHOUT 'delete' preceding it).
   * 
   *  2.  Updates to rows that don't exist in the original data.  These
   *      will include:
   *      a.  a field value for a row that doesn't exist either in the 
   *          original data or the changed data hash;
   *      b.  a field value for a row that exists in just the changed data 
   *          hash; and
   *      c.  a 'Removed' flag for a row that was added and subsequently
   *          deleted.
   *          
   *  Updates to existing data are compared to the corresponding value in the
   *  original data.  If they differ, the new value is added to the changed
   *  data hash, adding whatever parent objects are necessary.  If they match,
   *  the field is removed from the changed data hash, as are any parent objects
   *  that are left empty after the field is removed.  For delete and undelete
   *  instructions, alteration of the record id will correctly flag the row's
   *  status for later processing.
   *  
   *  Updates to new data are simply added to the changed data hash, creating
   *  any parent objects necessary.  The one exception to this is a blank 
   *  record id specification for a row that's been flagged as 'Removed'.  
   *  Removed rows are entirely blanked out, and so a blank field value will
   *  be passed to this function for every field in the row.  The 'Removed'
   *  flag, which is written to the record id field, is passed by a separate 
   *  function in the Data Model and may be received before the blank field 
   *  value for the record id is received.  We ignore this case to avoid
   *  'unflagging' the row.
   *  
   *  Note that although deleted rows can be undeleted, removed rows cannot.  
   *  So removed row numbers are not reused. 
   *

   * @param rowNum the row number in the table
   * @param fieldName the field in the row
   * @param value the new value
