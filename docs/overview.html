        <p>
          The PHR is a web-based system that can accomodate multiple users where
          each user may maintain health data for multiple people.  Data is
          maintained in a central database located on a server configured by the
          person or organization running the system.  Certain file content needs
          to be tailored to your specific installation.  Issues such as data
          security, accessibility, and performance under load must be managed by
          the controlling person or owner.  We provide a top-level description
          of how we handle those issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Server-side code is predominantly Ruby on Rails (RoR)</b>.  The standard
          RoR file structure and naming conventions are followed, although the
          code has evolved over time, and so some are followed more closely than
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Javascript is used heavily for client-side processing</b>.  Extensive
          caching of static content is used to lessen load times.  Various
          third-party javascript libraries, e.g., jQuery, Prototype, etc., are
          used to aid in creating javascript that is compatible with all current
          browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>508-compliant version</b> ("basic mode") is available for users
          with visual issues.  This version has been tested using JAWS.  It does not require javascript to be available on the client
          system, and does not include some of the non-core functionality
          available in the regular version (autosave, usage statistics, PHR
          sharing, specialized navigation, client-side validation).
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>mobile mode</b> is also available, and is based on the "basic
          mode" version as described above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Most of the forms used to present and acquire data are generated
          dynamically</b>, by form and field descriptions contained in the SQL
          database.  This allows for faster form generation and modifications
          as well as consistent form element appearance and behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system takes advantage of the <b>significant data resources of the
          NIH as well as other trusted resources</b> in the form of references
          to medical information specific to data entered for a health record,
          e.g., medical conditions, medications, allergies, vaccinations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Reminders</b> that are both health-specific (e.g., vaccine recommendations,
          screenings related to medical conditions) and due date-specific (e.g.,
          medication refill reminders, medical contact followup appointments, etc.)
          are generated based on various factors entered into a person's health 
          record.  Factors include things like age, gender, and current medical
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Navigation</b> on the forms is dictated by which form elements are shown
          at any particular time, what functions are available, and certain
          data entry rules.  For example, the main Health Summary page lists
          certain data previously entered, such as medical conditions,
          medications, allergies, etc., while making sure that focus starts
          at the first line at which data can be added.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Data entry validation</b> is performed mostly on the client side and is
          performed at the time of data entry for some fields, while at page
          submission time for others, as appropriate.  Validation avoids
          trapping a user in a field while enforcing validation rules where
          appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>User assistance</b> is provided on a field-level basis via tooltips and
          online help.  The online help also includes more general information
          related to data entry tips for various field types and form-level help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users may <b>allow others to have read-only access to PHR records</b>
          that they have created.  The other person must either already have an
          account in the PHR system or create one, and the access to the
          inviting user's PHR record is strictly restricted to read-only.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>User authentication</b> is performed at multiple levels, both at login and
          at each request for user data.  Initial account creation requires
          verification through the user's email address, which must be unique
          within the PHR system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PHR provides an <b>autosave functionality</b> for much of the data entered
          by the user.  This means that data entered into a form but not yet
          saved is not lost if the system crashes or the user's session terminates
          prematurely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain <b>usage statistics</b> are maintained for a user, including page
          accesses, session times, and the use of certain autocompleting lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PHR codebase includes <b>test files</b> used to verify functionality
          after code updates.  Following the Ruby on Rails convention, there are
          unit tests, functional tests, integration tests and javascript tests.
          There are also acceptance tests that use a system based on an older
          version of Selenium.
