            Using the PHR’s <strong>Health Record Details</strong> page, you can enter information about health conditions, surgeries, medications, allergies, and
            vaccinations. You can also enter due dates for doctor’s appointments, medication refills, and tests and procedures, and create custom due date
            reminders.
        </p>

            alt = "Photo of the Health Record Details page" />
        <p>
            The information buttons to the left of each row provide links to trusted educational resources, such as NLM MedlinePlus and CDC vaccine information
            sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Health Record Details</strong> page uses the individual’s demographic data (age, gender) to display fields for entering appropriate
            preventive screening results. For example, women in certain age groups have a place to enter mammogram and Pap smear results, while both men and women
            have a section for colon cancer screening and only men have prostate screening results.
