        (PHR)
    </h1>
    <p>
        You can create a Personal Health Record (PHR) for all family members using a single PHR Account ID. The PHR health record form automatically tailors
        itself to the age, gender and other characteristics of you or your family members. For example, the PHR system will only insert space for recording a
        mammogram result when the health record is for a woman who is the appropriate age for mammography. The PHR will also generate a unique form for each
        type of medical test, procedure, or health tracker.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a new PHR:
    </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>
            Click the <strong>Add New Person</strong> button on the <strong>PHR Home</strong> page. The PHR will generate a form to prompt for the following
            information about the new PHR being created. Fields highlighted with a <strong>*</strong> are required fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol start="1" type="a">
                <li>
                    <strong> </strong>
                    <strong>*</strong>
                    <strong>PHR Record Name:</strong>
                    Create a name for the personal health record. Use an alias or invented name such as "Self", "Son 1", or "Father" to maximize your privacy.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>*</strong>
                    <strong>Date of Birth:</strong>
                    Enter the date of birth for the family member whose health data is being entered. You can use either the full date or just the year of birth.
                    The birth date is used to generate health reminders tailored to the gender, age, and risk factors for each individual.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> </strong>
                    <strong>*</strong>
                    <strong>Gender:</strong>
                    Select the gender of the person from the drop down list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Race or Ethnicity:</strong>
                    Select the race/ethnicity of the person from the drop down list.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
           Click the <strong>Save</strong> button below the form fields to create the new PHR. The system will then display the            <strong>Health Record Details</strong> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the <strong>Health Record Details</strong> page, enter medical conditions, medications, allergies, tests, vaccinations, and medical contacts by
            selecting the name of each item from the drop down list, or select from the lists that appear as you start typing and get more specific as you
            enter more characters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter questions you want to ask the doctor as you think of them and bring them along on the next appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
            To save the PHR, click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the top or bottom of the page.
