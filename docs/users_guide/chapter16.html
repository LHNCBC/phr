        The PHR will help you keep track of preventive tests and screenings and remind you when you are due for important screening tests. You can view health
        reminders recommended by the <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstfix.htm">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> (USPSTF) and other esteemed
        sources such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) by clicking on the <strong>Health Reminders </strong>link at the top of the PHR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PHR analyzes all of the demographic and clinical data entered for each individual and creates customized health reminders based on USPSTF and CDC
        guidelines. The reminders include brief informative text as well as links to the appropriate USPSTF or CDC recommendation.

        We provide links to reliable health information so you can explore the evidence for these recommendations. The PHR offers reminders as a cue to you and
        your doctor about these preventive services, not as the final statement about which test is required and which is not.

To view a complete list of your drug refill dates, immunization and appointment reminders, and test due dates, click the        <strong>Date Reminders</strong> link at the top of the <strong>Health Record Details</strong> page.
