        to a Computer
    </h1>
    <p>
        You can download data from a PHR to a computer for use by other spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel. The browser will open a dialog box and
        prompt you to download the file from the PHR server to the computer. The file will be saved in the XLS spreadsheet file format and include data from
        the Health Summary and Test Results and Trackers; however, it will not include documents you have uploaded (imported).
    </p>
    <p>
        To download a PHR to a computer:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        On the <strong>PHR Home</strong> page, click on the name of the PHR you wish to download from the <strong>My Personal Health Records</strong> area.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Download</strong> button beneath the person's name to begin the download process.
    </li>
    <li>
        A dialog box will appear with instructions on how to download the file. The file name that will be generated will begin with the name of the PHR,
        followed by the date and time it was generated. i.e., child2_2014Feb0795122.xls
    </li>
    <li>
        You can use most spreadsheet programs to view the information and to print a copy for your records or for your health care provider.
    </li>
