    </h2>
    <p>
Expand or collapse all sections or the PHR by clicking <strong>Show All</strong> or <strong>Hide All</strong> links near the top right of the        <strong>Health Summary</strong> page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Show or hide individual sections by clicking the <strong>Show</strong> or <strong>Hide</strong> links in the top right corner of each section.

        <a id="_Toc408559523">12.2. Using the PHR's Drop-down Lists</a>
        to Enter Data
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once the user begin typing in a field with many possible responses, such as <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> or <strong>Drugs</strong>, the PHR will
        display a list of options based on the first few characters typed. The list of suggestions will become shorter as more letters are typed. Additionally,
        the PHR will offer synonyms based on the words entered. For example, the terms <strong>chest</strong> and <strong>thorax</strong> are synonyms. If the
word <strong>thorax </strong>is typed in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section, the list of selections will include        <strong>chest pain</strong>, <strong>chest trauma</strong>, <strong>thoracic surgery</strong>, <strong>hemothorax</strong>, etc., all of which relate
        to medical conditions associated with the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
        For fields with only a few possible responses, such as <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Allergy Type</strong>, the PHR will immediately display a
        list of options before a response is typed. For example, when you click inside the <strong>Allergy Type</strong> field, a list will pop up with the
        options <strong>Food</strong>, <strong>Medication classes</strong>, <strong>Medications specific</strong> and <strong>Other</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several ways to select an option from the list:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            <strong>Continue typing</strong>
            until the correct option is highlighted, then press the <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> key.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Point to the correct option</strong>
            on the choice list with your mouse and click it.
        </li>
        <li>
Use the <strong>Up Arrow</strong> or <strong>Down Arrow</strong> keys to move the highlight bar to the correct option and press the            <strong>Enter</strong> key.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Â· If the list of options is a numbered list, you need only <strong>enter the item number</strong><strong> next to your selection</strong> and the text
        will be filled into the form.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unable to find your desired option in the drop-down list, describe the condition in your own words. The system will italicize the text and
        turn the input field orange to remind you that you are not choosing an item from the selection list; however, the system will still accept and store
        the text.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <a id="_Toc408559524">12.3. Bypassing Drop-down Lists</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        In most fields selecting from the drop-down lists is optional. For example, if you do not find the id of a drug you are taking in the drop-down list,
        you may type it in yourself. The system will italicize the text and change the background of the field to orange to remind you that you are not
        choosing an item from the drop-down list; however, the system will still accept and store the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a few special fields, such as the <strong>Status</strong> field in the <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> section of the PHR, the system will limit
        entry to one of the valid items from the list. Any invalid data you enter into the field will be deleted.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <a id="_Toc408559525">12.4. Entering Dates</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are three ways to enter a date in any date field in the PHR:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Manually <strong>type the date in your preferred format</strong>. Once you type your entry, the PHR will convert it to the standard format used by
        the PHR system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Click on the calendar</strong> to the right of the field, find the correct date in the pop-up, and click it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use one of the date shortcuts</strong> outlined below which will allow you to enter dates using a minimum number of keystrokes.
    </li>  
    </ol>
    <ol class="indent">
    <h3>
        <a id="_Toc408559526">12.4.1. Shortcuts for entering today's date and related dates</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        You can enter today's date by typing <strong>T</strong> or <strong>today</strong> (either upper or lower case).
    </li>
        <li>
            You can also type the words <strong>tomorrow</strong> or <strong>yesterday</strong> as a substitute for entering numeric dates.
        </li>
        <li>
            The letters <strong>D</strong>, <strong>W</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong> (either upper or lower case) can be used as
            shorthand to for the words <strong>days</strong>, <strong>weeks</strong>, <strong>months</strong> (30 days), or <strong>years</strong> (365 days).
        </li>
        <li>
        You can enter days of the week by entering the full name of the day or an abbreviation for the day such as <strong>mon</strong>, <strong>tue</strong>
        , <strong>wed</strong>, <strong>thur</strong>, or <strong>fri</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The letters <strong>D</strong>, <strong>W</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong> (either upper or lower case) can be used in
            conjunction with a whole number <em>n</em>, and a plus or minus sign (<strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong>) or the words <strong>next</strong>
or <strong>last</strong> as shorthand to for the words <strong>days</strong>, <strong>weeks</strong>, <strong>months</strong> (30 days), or            <strong>years</strong> (365 days). For example,
        </li>
        <li>
To enter dates in the future, you can use a plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) or the word <strong>next</strong>. Typing <strong>T+</strong><em>n</em> (        <strong>D</strong>,<strong>W</strong>,<strong>M,Y</strong>) will allow you to enter a specific number of days, weeks, months, and years in the future.
        For example, entering <strong>T+3M</strong> will input a date that is exactly three months from today's date. Entering <strong>next y</strong> will
        input a date one year from today's date.
    </li>
    <li>For dates in the past use a minus sign (<strong>-</strong>) or the word <strong>last</strong>. Typing <strong>T-</strong><em>n</em> (        <strong>D</strong>,<strong>W</strong>,<strong>M,Y</strong>) will allow you to enter a specific number of days, weeks, months, or years in the past. For
example, entering <strong>T-1W</strong> or <strong>T-7D</strong> or the words <strong>last w</strong> will enter a date of one week ago. Entering        <strong>last m</strong> will input a date exactly one month ago.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>
            Please note that entering the letters <strong>D</strong>, <strong>W</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, or <strong>Y</strong> alone will input the
            current date.
        </em>
        For example, entering the letter <strong>y</strong> will input today's date; however, entering <strong>yesterday</strong> will input yesterday's date.
        The fastest way to enter yesterday's date is by entering <strong>t-1</strong>.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        <a id="_Toc408559527">12.5. Entering Times</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Enter times using either whole numbers (<em>hours</em>) or using <em>hours</em><strong>:</strong><em>minutes</em> format.
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            Once you enter a time, the PHR will convert it to a standard time format with either an <strong>AM</strong> or <strong>PM</strong> designation.
        </li>
    <li>
        If you enter the time using numbers between 1 and 12 and do not designate AM or PM, the time will be set to AM hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the numbers 13 through 24 for PM hours or enter the time followed by <strong>P</strong> or <strong>PM</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can enter a time of "now" by typing <strong>N</strong> or <strong>Now</strong> (case is not important).
    </li>
    <li>
        For times in the future, use a plus sign(<strong>+</strong>). That is, <strong>N+</strong><em>n</em> would be the current time plus <em>n</em> number
        of minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        For times in the past, use minus sign(<strong>-</strong>). That is, <strong>N-</strong><em>n</em> would be <em>n</em> minutes before the current
        time.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <a id="_Toc408559528">12.6. Fixing Input Errors</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        If information that the PHR does not understand is entered (such as a date in an incorrect format), the system will sound a soft beep, highlight the
        field in red and shake the field from right to left (as in ânoâ).

        To make changes to an item that has already been saved, click the icon at the beginning of the row to edit or delete the item. Note that fields
