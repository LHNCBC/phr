    </h1>
    <p>
        The PHR Account ID is the unique identifier you use to access all of the Personal Health Records maintained by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Longer and more complex Account IDs are more secure; however, you should choose an Account ID that will be easy to remember. Avoid using any personal
        identifiers as part of your Account ID to ensure your privacy. Personal identifiers include information such as names, social security numbers,
        addresses, or telephone numbers.
    </p>
    <p>

        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                can be from 6 to 32 characters long
            </li>
            <li>
                must begin with a letter
            </li>
            <li>
                can contain a combination of letters, numbers, and underscore (_) characters
            </li>
            <li>
                is not case-sensitive
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        You can create multiple Personal Health Records using the same PHR account ID.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PHR includes an Account ID recovery option through the <strong>Account ID</strong> recovery link in the middle of the <strong>PHR Login</strong>
        page. You must supply the answers to three security questions that you established when the account was created and you must have access to the email
        address associated with your PHR Account ID in order to recover your account without assistance.
