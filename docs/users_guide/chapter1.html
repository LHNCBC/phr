                The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Personal Health Record (PHR) is a web-based software tool designed to be used by a patient or family caregiver.
                The PHR is supported “behind the scenes” by the clinical vocabulary standards that are NLM-supported and required by Meaningful Use of Electronic
                Medical Records (Stage 2) regulations to help with health information exchange.

                            You can store and manage the health data – health conditions, medications, vaccine history, allergies, surgeries, etc. – for each of your family
                            members. The PHR can yield a summary of key health data to unify the fragments and notes from different visits to different doctors and hospitals.

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            You can track and graph laboratory test results to see improvements over time, relationships between activities and outcomes (for example, exercise
                            and blood pressure), and areas that might need more attention.
