      <div id="main_title">The NLM Personal Health Record (PHR)</div>
        <p>The NLM Personal Health Record is a web-based tool designed to allow
        consumers to keep track of their own health information as well as
        that of their children and elderly or other dependents.  It takes
        advantage of national coding and terminology standards available
        from the NLM.</p>

        <p id="retired_note">The NLM PHR has been retired but you may still
          download it and set it up in your local environment.  See the <a
              href="#Download">Download the PHR System</a> section below.

        </p>
        <p>This application was developed by staff in the Computer Science
              Branch at the U.S. National Library of Medicine under the direction
        of Clement J. McDonald, MD, Director, Lister Hill National Center for
            Biomedical Communications. Federal research staff includes Paul Lynch,
            Project Manager, and Ye Wang, Senior Systems Developer at the National
        Library of Medicine.</p>

        <p>The PHR is a web-based system.  The server code is written primarily
             in Ruby on Rails, and the client side code is written in Javascript.
            A MySQL database contains both user and program data.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <h3>Single Account for All Family Members</h3>
        <p>An entire family's health information is managed within one account
        by creating individual health records for each family member.</p>

      <h3>Customized Health Reminders</h3>
      <p>The PHR creates customized health reminders for each user based on
           national health guidelines by analyzing all of the demographic and
      clinical data entered for each individual. Reminders are based on U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Centers for Disease Control
      (CDC) guidelines but can be customized to use any sources. The reminders
      include brief informative text as well as links to the appropriate USPSTF
      or CDC recommendation.</p>

    <h3>Date Reminders</h3>
        <p>The PHR creates date-based reminders for each user based information
             entered for things like medication refill due dates, next appointment
        dates, next vaccination dates, etc.</p>

    <h3>Links to Trusted Health Information</h3>
       <p>The PHR provides one-click access to trusted consumer health
    oriented resources both inside and outside the US National Library of
       Medicine through the use of information buttons that are created at
       the time of data entry.</p>

    <h3>Comprehensive Test Panel and Health Tracker Entry</h3>
    <p>The PHR includes an "Add Tests & Measures" section where individuals can
    enter laboratory, radiology, and diagnostic test results. They can also keep
    track of disease and symptoms such as diabetes and wheezing associated with
        asthma, as well as lifestyle measures such as sleep, mood, nutrition, and
    exercise. These panels are easy to customize for a particular group or
    institution's needs.</p>

    <h3>Test Panel Flowsheet</h3>
    <p>The PHR results timeline flowsheet allows the user to see test results
         and health trackers over time. The graphing feature makes it easy to
    view test results and health trends as well as get detailed information about
    specific data points.</p>

    <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>The data for an individual may be shared with others.  This feature is
         enabled only on the request of the person who created the health record,
        by explicitly granting read-only access to someone they specify.</p>

        <h1>See the PHR System</h1>
          <p>
            The NLM PHR demonstration system has been retired as of September
            27, 2018.  As with the demonstration system, sample accounts are
            included in the version available as a virtual machine (see #2
            below), although they are not the same accounts.
          </p>
        <h1 id="Download">Download the PHR System</h1>
          <p>
            The code for the system remains available in two forms:
            <ol>
              <li>as downloadable source code from
                <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/phr">GitHub</a>, which
                requires separate installation of supporting third-party packages
                and building the code as described on the Github site.
                Installation instructions are provided as part of the <a
                href="docs">technical documentation</a>.</li>
              <li>as a <a href="startup.html">virtual machine (VM)</a>, which
                can be imported into a third-party virtual machine package, e.g.,
                <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">Oracle's Virtual Box</a>
                VM Manager, then tailored for your organization's name, etc.,
                and run as is.  Note that if you want to use it for something
                real, you will want to update the VM's operating system, ruby, and other
                third-party packages so it is secure, because we have stopped updating
                the VM.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <h1>Review the Details</h1>
          <p>
            Both <a href="docs">technical documentation and a user's guide</a> are
            available.  The <a href="docs/users_guide/tableofcontents.html">PHR
            User's Guide</a> provides detailed descriptions of the functions and
            usage of the NLM PHR system.
