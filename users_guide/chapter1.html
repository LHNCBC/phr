                The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Personal Health Record (PHR) is a web-based software tool designed to be used by a patient or family caregiver.
                The PHR is supported “behind the scenes” by the clinical vocabulary standards that are NLM-supported and required by Meaningful Use of Electronic
                Medical Records (Stage 2) regulations to help with health information exchange.
            </p>

               A demo version of the PHR <a href="https://phr-demo.nlm.nih.gov/">https://phr-demo.nlm.nih.gov/</a>, which is accessible from any
                computer, allows you to create a temporary account to explore the software.

                            You can store and manage the health data – health conditions, medications, vaccine history, allergies, surgeries, etc. – for each of your family
                            members. The PHR can yield a summary of key health data to unify the fragments and notes from different visits to different doctors and hospitals.

                            and blood pressure), and areas that might need more attention.
